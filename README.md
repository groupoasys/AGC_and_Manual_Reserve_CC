# Data of 118-node Power System 🌩️

## Goals 🚀

The aim of this repository is to provide the details of the power systems data set used in papers [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05746). This article have been developed by some members of the [OASYS group](https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home) thanks to the funding of the project [Flexanalytics](https://groupoasysflexanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We suggest you to visit the related links to know more our research 😉

## Contents 🌌

This repository includes data of the 118-node system, which is extracted from a [repository of power grids](https://github.com/power-grid-lib/pglib-opf).
